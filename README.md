<h3 id = "Filter_ROIs_by_any_Value">Filter ROIs by any table values</h3>
<p>The standard ImageJ/Fiji analyze options amkies it easy to filter by object area and circularity and the  <a href="https://imagej.net/BioVoxxel_Toolbox">Biovoxxel Extended Particle Analyzer</a> extends this filter capability to 14 standard parameters but what if you want more? This <a href="https://github.com/peterjlee/asc-filter-ROIs-by-any-parameter"  Title = "Applied Superconductivity Center Filter ROIs by any Results table parameter directory" >macro</a> allows you to filter ROIs by any parameter in the Results table. This makes it possible to filter using the extended geometrical features above or for feature values created by other plugins, for instance the Particles4 and Particles8 plugins included in the "<a href="https://blog.bham.ac.uk/intellimic/g-landini-software/">Morphological Operators for ImageJ</a>" set developed by <a href="http://www.mecourse.com/landinig/software/software.html">Gabriel Landini</a>.</p>
<p>Additional features include:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preferences are automatically saved in the ImageJ user preferences file.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mean and standard deviations (including ln-based values) are provided for each chosen parameter.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standard deviation based ranges can be easily selected.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The filtered-out object color can be changed.<br />
